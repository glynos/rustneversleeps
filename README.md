# Rust Never Sleeps Community Book Discussion

This repo contains some examples that we use as part of a reading group covering
Rust for Rustaceans.

The first 7 examples attempt to cover chapter 1. Examples 1, 2 and 3 demonstrate
variables and different memory regions. Examples 4 to 7 introduce move semantics
the concept of ownership.
